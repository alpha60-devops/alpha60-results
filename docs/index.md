The alpha60 project publishes results in two data interchange formats:

* <a href="https://github.com/bdekoz/alpha60-results/tree/master/csv">csv</a> files, which contain <a href="data-csv.html">details</a> of per-duration (day, week hour) swarm phenomena
* <a href="https://github.com/bdekoz/alpha60-results/tree/master/json/cumulative">json</a> files, which contain <a href="data-json.html">details</a> of cumulative swarm phenomena (total unique peers, top 10 geographic locations, resolution characteristics, transfer size)
